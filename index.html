    <p>
        My name is Mario Rivas, and I am currently studying computer science. I enjoy building web pages using HTML and CSS, and I aim to transfer to CSULB to complete my bachelor's degree. In my free time, I like to stay active and productive. I am passionate about self-improvement and constantly learning new things. I hope to use my skills to build useful and creative projects in the future.
